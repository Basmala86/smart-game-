✔ Multiple Algorithms – Compare classical and AI-based pathfinding methods.
✔ Real-Time Visualization – Watch algorithms explore the grid step-by-step.
✔ Adjustable Speed – Control simulation speed for better understanding.
✔ Performance Tracking – Measures steps taken and success rate.

🔍 Algorithms Implemented
Classical Algorithms
Algorithm	Description	Strengths	Weaknesses
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)	Swarm intelligence-based optimization	Fast, simple	Local optima traps
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)	Pheromone-based pathfinding	Works well in mazes	Slow convergence
Perceptron	Single-layer neural network	Very fast decisions	Limited to linear paths
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	Linear classifier	Better than Perceptron	Still linear
Revolutionary Algorithms
Algorithm	Description	Strengths	Weaknesses
Quantum PSO (QPSO)	Quantum-inspired optimization	Avoids local optima	Computationally heavy
Transformer-Based	Attention-based pathfinding	Adapts to dynamic obstacles	Needs tuning
Neuromorphic	Spiking neural network approach	Brain-like efficiency	Slow learning
⚙️ Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Tkinter (usually included with Python)

NumPy, scikit-learn

Steps
Clone the repository:

sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-game.git
cd pathfinding-game
Install dependencies:

sh
pip install numpy scikit-learn
Run the game:

sh
python main.py
🎮 Usage
Set Up the Grid

Left-click to place obstacles.

Use the Terrain Tools to add water, mountains, or forests.

Click Add Target to place goal positions.

Select an Algorithm

Choose from the dropdown menu (e.g., "Quantum PSO").

Start Simulation

Click Start and adjust speed with the slider.

Reset & Experiment

Use Reset to clear the grid and try different algorithms.

🤖 How It Works
Classical AI (PSO, ACO) – Uses swarm intelligence and pheromones.

Machine Learning (Perceptron, SVM) – Pre-trained models for decision-making.

Quantum & Neuromorphic – Simulates quantum states and spiking neurons.

(For a full technical explanation, see the Report.md.)

🚀 Future Improvements
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN) – Adaptive learning agent.

Genetic Algorithm – Evolutionary path optimization.

3D Visualization – Pygame/Unity integration.

Multi-Agent Systems – Cooperative pathfinding.
